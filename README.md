# JP-JS

This is a library of server/client agnostic javascript functions. This is built because I wanted consistency across applications. Gone are the days where I will have to look up that phone regex expression or a mm/dd/yyyy date formatter.

### Things to know

- This library will never have npm dependencies like react because it would create a dependency for non react applications such as web server.
- All functions are written and exported in typescript. If this library grows to be helpful time saver, then I'll package this library to support javascript only applciations.
- This library is meant for my personal projects. If you decide to use this, you will be at the mercy to how I change these for my projects. I suggest to fork this project and make your own. It will look great on your resume :)
- I will follow [sematic versioning](https://semver.org/)
